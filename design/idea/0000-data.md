## Summary

Programs primarily manipulate data, so a programming language needs good support not only for modelling processes, but also the data these processes manipulate.

For Origami, we're interested in modelling data structures that:

- Support evolution. That is, we must support defining and extending data structure definitions **without** breaking existing code. This rules out positional values and tagged unions (as commonly implemented).

- Support precise modelling. So we must support scalar types, aggregate types, and one-of types.

- Support serialisation and parsing.

- Support encapsulation with fine-grained capabilities. It should be possible to provide a read-only access to a single field in a data structure to someone without giving them access to the whole data structure. Same for write-only accesses.

This document describes how Origami achieves these goals.

## Records

In principle, Origami only has _record_ types. And they're anonymous and extensible. For example:

```
let point2d = { x: 1, y: 2 };
```

Constructs an anonymous record containing two labels, `x` and `y`, whose associated values are `1` and `2`. We could construct a new point based on this one:

```
let point3d = { ...point2d, z: 0 };
```

This constructs a point that has the same properties as the one referenced by `point2d`, plus the property `z`. The additional properties can also be used to override labels in the new record:

```
let point3d' = { ...point3d, z: 2 };
```

This constructs a new point that has `z = 2`, but the old `point3d` value is not changed. New records efficiently share the properties of the old ones, so the instantiation cost is proportional to the number of new/overriden properties, rather than all of the properties.

### Using records

We may use any value associated with a label by projecting it. For example:

```
let xyz = point3d.x + point3d.y + point3d.z;
```

We may access the values through pattern matching. For example:

```
let xyz = match point3d {
  case { x: a, y: b, z: c } -> a + b + c;
  // or as a short form:
  case { x, y, z } -> x + y + z;
}
```

Pattern matching also allows matching only parts of the record:

```
let xy = match point3d {
  case { x, y } -> x + y;
}
```

### Capabilities

The record form provides a way of constructing simple, extensible records, but does not give us anything to control who gets to access which pieces of data, and what they can do with it.
