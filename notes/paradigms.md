# Object-Oriented Programming

Most features in Origami come from OOP (even the more functional ones).

The OOP model in Origami is prototype-based (as in JavaScript), but syntactical support for traits, classes, and more is provided.

# Imperative Programming

Like JavaScript, Origami supports imperative programming and structured code-blocks.

# Functional and Function-based programming

Origami extends JavaScript's support for functional/function-based programming by adding extensible pattern matching, syntactic partial application, pipes, modules, and named parameters.
